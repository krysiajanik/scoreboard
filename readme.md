# Scoreboard

Keep score with your friends and family!

## Idea

For all those who always feel like it's them doing the dishes, walking the dog or doing something nice for the other person - now you can have proof. 

## How it works?

So far it doesn't - early "development" stage. Design done by me, now I'm focusing on expressing it in code. I will be able to do basic js functions, but it would work much better with a little bit more advanced coding - hoping I will get there in time

## What's to come?

### External hosting

To allow for user to access their account and scores from various devices

### Connect with google account

Probably a couple months before I get how to do this, but the aim is to be able to log via user's google account and invite their partner / firend / family member to "cooperate" 

## Any ideas on how to improve?

Let me know! I'm still learnig obviously, so any ideas or constructive criticism is welcome!
